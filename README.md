# Localisation
**The easy way to translate your php websites**

This project is a personal tool helping me to store translations/localisation on my scratch
projects.

 - It doesn't needs any instalation. For persistance, i'll use .txt files.
 - It's very simple to use. You will surround your texts with a functions.
 - Furthermore, it keeps the original language in your views so it's easy to edit and
update.
